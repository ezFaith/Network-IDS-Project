Summary of Commands to Update Your App


Stage your local changes:

git add .

This command adds all your modified files (e.g., app.py, requirements.txt) to the staging area, preparing them for the next step.


Commit your changes:

git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"

This saves the staged changes to your local Git history. The message should briefly describe what you changed.


Push your changes to GitHub:

git push origin main

This sends the committed changes from your local machine to the main branch of your GitHub repository.
